The physical exam revealed cyanosis, inspiratory stridor, and tachypnea with suprasternal and subcostal retractions. During intubation, a laryngeal cystic mass at the base of the tongue was identified. Tracheal intubation was performed, and a flexible fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy was performed which showed a cystic mass arising from laryngeal and lingual mucosa of the left epiglottis and obliterating pyriform sinus.\n",

On day 3, endoscopic marsupialization of the cyst was done, as confirmed by diagnostic direct laryngoscopy. Histopathological analysis revealed a cyst lined by non-keratinizing squamous epithelium with evidence of chronic inflammation in fibrous tissue.

      "The patient, an 83-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of barking cough, shortness of breath, and wheezing. The patient had a history of recurrent exacerbations of bronchial asthma for the past three years and was suspected to have brittle asthma. The patient was also a diabetic and hypertensive and had undergone left pneumonectomy 40 years ago for pulmonary tuberculosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "On admission, the patient had tachypnea with respiratory rate of 28/min and hypoxia with SpO2 of 89% on room air. Examination of the respiratory system revealed shift of trachea to left, audible stridor, absent air entry on the left side, and conducted sounds on the right side. Arterial Blood Gas analysis revealed an acidotic state with hypercapnia and hypoxia. 2D Echocardiography showed normal LV function, Mild RV dysfunction, dilated RA/RV, mild TR, and plethoric IVC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient was given intravenous hydrocortisone, calcium gluconate infusion, and NIV-BiPAP support. CT scan of Neck and Chest showed left post-pneumonectomy status, thickening and calcification of left pleura, tortuous trachea with acute angulation at the thoracic inlet, gross shift of mediastinum to the left, multiple spiculated lesions with surrounding fibrosis, multiple calcified pretracheal lymph nodes, and compensatory hyperinflation of right lung. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy showed severe narrowing of trachea during inspiration and near-total closure during expiration suggestive of tracheomalacia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the worsening of arterial blood gas values and respiratory failure, the patient was intubated and mechanically ventilated. However, the patient was considered unsuitable for invasive surgical procedures in view of poor general condition, high risk for anesthetic complications, and generalized debility. He was unsuitable for placement of stent due to long segment tracheobronchial involvement. The patient refused further invasive procedures. Long length tracheostomy tube was placed with the tip of the tracheostomy tube a few centimeters from the level of carina. Patency of lower trachea was maintained, and chest radiography showed well-aerated right lung. The patient was discharged with tracheostomy used as an interface for BiPAP ventilator with no requirement for supplemental oxygen.\n",

The uterus showed multiple sub-serosal and intramural fibroids. The left ovary, measuring 7 cm × 7.5 cm × 4 cm, was totally replaced by a nodular gray-white solid encapsulated homogeneous mass showing a whorling pattern on the cut surface. Sections from the ovarian mass showed typical leiomyoma histomorphology having intersecting short fascicles of spindle cells similar to the uterine leiomyoma. There was no evidence of increased mitosis, atypia, and necrosis, ruling out the possibility of leiomyosarcoma. The endometrium showed features of hyperplasia with focal atypia.

Laboratory results showed 4+ protein in her urinalysis and a 10.9 g 24-hour urine protein, which led to suspicion of preeclampsia although she remained normotensive. The patient lacked any features of HELLP syndrome or neurological disturbances. Laboratory investigations revealed elevated serum creatinine, hypoalbuminemia, elevated triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Fetal growth was monitored, and delivery was induced at 37 weeks of gestation.\n",

      "Upon arrival at our hospital, the patient had no complaints apart from the progression of symmetric lower extremity swelling. Laboratory tests from the antepartum period were repeated, and they remained consistent, except for worsened creatinine. The spot urine protein to creatinine ratio was 7.6. Further evaluation of the nephrotic syndrome revealed speckled ANA (1: 160 titer) and positive anti-DsDNA, anti-Sm, and anti-RNP antibodies. The patient's C3 and C4 complement levels were normal, and tests for ANCA, SSA/SSB, RF, anti-CCP, Hep C Ab, Hep BsAg, and HIV were all negative. Anti-phospholipid antibody screening was positive for anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Renal sonogram was unremarkable.\n",

      "On postpartum day 8, a renal biopsy showed a mild increase in mesangial cellularity and matrix consistent with class II LN. Immunofluorescence study of the biopsy was positive for focal mesangial granular deposits of IgG, IgA, and C1q. Electron microscopy revealed a mildly thickened glomerular basement membrane with patchy effacement of foot processes, scant mesangial electron-dense deposits with focal increase in mesangial matrix as well as tubuloreticular inclusions in the glomerular capillary endothelium.\n",

      "The patient is a 22-year-old East African woman with vertically acquired HIV who had been diagnosed shortly after birth. She has been on zidovudine monotherapy, which was later switched to stavudine, lamivudine, and nelfinavir. Despite the addition of various antiretroviral drugs to her regimen, she had poor virological control due to poor adherence, adverse reactions to the medication, and a lack of family support. After re-engaging in care, the patient received maraviroc, etravirine, and twice-daily darunavir/ritonavir and achieved virological suppression. However, she later disengaged from care once again for a period of 8 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "On re-engaging in care, the patient's VL was 1610 copies/mL, and her CD4 was 104 cells/mm3. Resistance testing showed NRTI, NNRTI, and PI resistance, with PI resistance to nelfinavir. This regimen was then simplified to darunavir/ritonavir and maraviroc, and later to darunavir/ritonavir monotherapy once virological suppression was achieved. However, the patient's VL rebounded, and DTG 50 mg once a day was added to her regimen. Poor engagement continued, and later integrase resistance testing showed the R263K mutation, which was confirmed by NGS. To avoid accumulation of integrase resistance mutations with ongoing poor adherence, she was switched to tenofovir, darunavir/ritonavir. Follow-up NGS sequencing 3 months after the first resistance test showed the R263K mutation at <5% in a sample with a VL of 61 000 copies/mL. \n",

      "The patient, a 42-year-old army man, presented with the sudden loss of consciousness, left arm and left truncal twitching during an air flight. Prior to that, he also had a frontal headache and dizziness. The neurological examination on admission was remarkable for facial asymmetry and reduced power of the left upper limb though tone and reflexes were intact. On further examination, reduced breath sounds on the upper and middle zones of the left lung were noted. CT scans confirmed the presence of a giant bulla on the patient's upper left lung, and the patient was diagnosed with giant apical bullous emphysema.\n",

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a prepyloric gastric ulcer, body verrucous gastritis, and reflux esophagitis. Colonoscopy revealed a solitary rectal polyp that was removed through cold snare excision. Pathological examination of the polyp confirmed a tubular adenomatous type, which is known to be a precancerous lesion. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms improved following the procedure, and the subsequent follow-up colonoscopy showed no observable mucosal lesions.

Ascites was diagnosed and drained, revealing hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and bilateral papilloedema. Blood analysis showed low hemoglobin levels, a reduced white blood cell count, significantly low platelet count, high unbound bilirubin concentration, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. A diagnosis of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) was confirmed via peripheral blood flow cytometry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans identified Budd-Chiari Syndrome (BCS) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) identified thromboses of the left transverse and superior sagittal cerebral sinus veins. Anticoagulation therapy was initiated, and the patient also received supplemental oral iron and folic acid. Despite this, BCS progressed, and the patient received a TIPS to address refractory ascites and congestive hepatomegaly. Furthermore, eculizumab treatment was initiated in January 2009, resulting in notable improvements over more than 40 months of therapy.\n",

      "The patient, a 36-year-old Asian woman, was admitted to our hospital with an incidental finding of an abdominal mass in the right lower abdomen. She underwent laparoscopy-assisted right hemicolectomy with partial resection of the anterior wall of the duodenum, in order to resect the tumor en bloc. It was confirmed that the patency of the duodenal lumen was preserved after the surgery. The resected specimen yielded a yellowish-white solid tumor measuring 40 × 40 × 25mm, which directly involved the muscularis propria of the transverse colon, and was very close to the duodenal muscularis propria. The surgical margin was confirmed to be negative for tumor cells. The diagnosis of colonic desmoid tumor was established through pathological examination and immunohistochemical analysis. Mutational analyses of the β-catenin gene (CTNNB1) and APC gene were performed, and then a point mutation of the CTNNB1 gene was found at codon 41, which is consistent with a dysregulation of the Wnt-adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-β-catenin signaling cascade.\n",

No postoperative adjuvant treatment was done because the patient did not want to take it due to her desire to preserve her fertility.

After his stabilization, he was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Unit for further investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon admission, he was icteric, with conjunctival suffusion and arthritis in both knees and ankles. He was previously healthy and had been in Greece for at least 15 months, with household exposure as the only risk factor for the specific infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's laboratory tests showed an elevated white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, acute renal failure, and abnormal protein levels. A multiplex PCR for Neisseria meningitidis was negative as well as the tests for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and hantavirus. An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction lower than 30. A knee puncture was performed and depicted noninfectious arthritis, whereas a rapid agglutination test and IgM antibodies for leptospira were positive.\n",

      "The patient was treated with penicillin, meropenem, and vancomycin, with cardiac and renal function normalization and afebrile status achieved within four weeks of hospitalization. However, a new complication occurred during the third week of hospitalization. A slow progressive necrosis of soft tissue in both feet due to vasculitis was diagnosed, which was treated with antibiotics, vasodilators, aspirin, and minor surgical interventions instead of a both feet below the knee amputation. Additionally, the patient presented with a second episode of polyarthritis and mononeuritis multiplex, successfully controlled with prednisolone, pregabalin, and analgesics. \n",

      "\n",
      "Treated with subretinal fluid drainage, endolaser, and gas tamponade, the patient had an uncomplicated repair. An afferent pupillary defect was observed in the right eye, along with temporal visual field loss. The patient was urgently referred to the emergency department, where a non-contrast axial CT scan of the brain revealed intraocular gas fill with foci of gas in the intraorbital and canalicular segments of the left optic nerve, extending to the optic chiasm, and pneumocephalus in the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the otherwise nonfocal neurologic examination, close, cautious observation was advised with follow-up CT scan in one week, which showed resolution of the pneumocephalus and optic nerve gas. One month later, the patient's vision had returned to 20/20 in the right, but the temporal field defect persisted, and the left eye remained light perception only. Dilated fundus examination showed a healthy appearing optic nerve in the right eye and diffuse optic nerve pallor in the left eye.\n",

Despite having undergone resection of a facial melanoma sixteen years prior and having metastases to the lung and brain, he underwent aggressive loco-regional treatment, including metastasectomy for the liver lesion, high dose interleukin-2, and chemotherapy. He had a good response to these modalities with complete regression of the liver and lung lesions, but a PET scan revealed a new gallbladder lesion that was identified. The patient then underwent open cholecystectomy, where a metastatic melanoma was confirmed in the gallbladder mucosa with all margins free of tumor. An additional peri-portal focus of melanoma was also identified and resected. The patient made an uneventful post-operative recovery. However, he subsequently progressed with widely metastatic disease in the central nervous system and died four months after surgical intervention for the gallbladder.\n",

She had a blood pressure reading of 150/80 mmHg, height of 96 cm (25th percentile), and weighed 19.7 kg (>97th percentile) with a body mass index of 21.4 kg/m2 (>97th percentile). A plethoric moon face, hypertrichosis, and spotty pigmentation on her conjunctivae, lips, and oral mucosa were observed. She had no specific medical history, including tumors or adrenal disease, in her family. She had elevated urinary cortisol levels and serum cortisol level after a high dose dexamethasone suppression test.\n",

      "Hospital Course:\n",
      "The patient underwent a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy as she had nodular thickening of the left adrenal gland which revealed adrenocortical micronodular hyperplasia. As her symptoms of cortisol excess persisted, right adrenalectomy was performed. The pathology of both adrenal glands revealed micronodular adrenocortical disease. The patient was then evaluated for Carney complex, but the heart and thyroid gland ultrasonography were negative. No deletion or duplication was identified in protein kinase A regulatory subunit type 1A (PRKAR1A) gene analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The patient complained of left hip pain at the age of 8 years, and her physical exam revealed a bone protrusion in the left temporal area. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her hip revealed overall polyostotic bone tumors involving the bilateral femurs, ilium, and sacrum. Her brain MRI revealed multiple multilocular cystic bone lesions involving the clivus, bifrontal skull base, bilateral sphenoid, and left temporal bones. The right temporal bone biopsy demonstrated osteoid producing neoplasms, consistent with osteoblastoma.\n",

An orthopantomogram of the region revealed an ill-defined osteolytic lesion involving the ramus condyle unit of the right side of size 3 cm x 1.5 cm. A computerized tomographic scan showed a well encapsulated fluid-filled cystic lesion of size 4.9 cm x 3.8 cm with osteolysis and thinning out of the condylar unit encroaching the infratemporal region and abutting the pterygoid plates on the right side.\n",

      "The patient, a 12-year-old girl diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot, was admitted for intracardiac repair. She had a history of dyspnea on moderate exertion with cyanosis, squatting spells, and a room air saturation of 92??5%, which she had been experiencing since the age of three. Prior to the procedure, the patient was administered Inj ketamine 190 mg IM and Inj glycopyrrolate 85 μg intramuscularly to ease the separation from her parents in the preoperative area. Following this, she was taken to the operating room (OR) where she was further induced with Inj fentanyl 50 μg IV and Inj pancuronium 6 mg IV. The patient's trachea was intubated, a 2D pediatric TEE probe was inserted, and she was mechanically ventilated while undergoing surgery. The procedure consisted of infundibular muscle resection, dacron patch closure of perimembranous VSD, and augmentation of pulmonary artery with autologous pericardial patch. After completion of the surgery and weaning off from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the patient showed a sudden drop in SPO2 and rise in PIP. Suspecting a mucus plug, ET suction was performed but was unsuccessful. With high airway pressure, the right lung popped up, and the mechanical ventilation was started again. However, the right lung did not deflate and inflate cyclically, so the TEE probe was suspected to cause the obstruction and was subsequently removed, after which the ventilation returned to normal. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged four days later with follow-up instructions.\n",

      "The patient, a 42-year-old man, presented to the hospital with diffuse pain in the right lower quadrant, petechiae on his right lower limb, and a fever of 38°C. An angiographic investigation revealed a pseudoaneurysm at the site of the previous arterial ligation, which was excluded by deploying three balloon expandable cover stents during the same procedure. Subsequent to the interventional procedure, the patient continued to run a fever and developed clinical signs of thromboembolism that were confirmed by angiography. The patient was treated for thromboembolism through embolectomy, but histological examination of the thrombus identified mucorales hyphae. The stents were also found to be infected with mucorales upon histological examination. The patient underwent surgery for removal of both the mycotic aneurysm and the stents and for the construction of a suprapubic femoral-femoral bypass. The patient was given treatment with amphotericin B for three months, and no recurrence or any other major complications were recorded during the eight-year follow-up period. The patient was able to undergo a kidney transplantation successful sometime later.\n",

Bone scintigraphy showed no bone metastasis.\n",

      "The patient had breast cancer of the left breast three years earlier during her second pregnancy. No metastasis was noted at that time and the breast cancer was treated with mastectomy. Two years later, she underwent prophylactic mastectomy of the right breast. Pathologic evaluation of the primary tumor showed a poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma, negative for the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and negative for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu).\n",
      "\n",
      "Hospital Course:\n",
      "She was enrolled in a clinical trial that aimed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood progenitor cell support in women with advanced-stage breast cancer. After two cycles of FE120C, the mass in the lung was much smaller, and her voice improved. She subsequently received three cycles of high-dose chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in combination with PBPC support. The high-dose chemotherapy induced a complete radiologic remission of the metastatic sites. She subsequently received locoregional consolidation radiation to the left apical lung and mediastinum. Due to high-dose chemotherapy, she developed irreversible alopecia and ovarian suppression.\n",

The pathology of the tumor was revised, and it was concluded that the tumor was a spindle cell tumor surrounded by an extensive lymphatic infiltrate and densely vascularized by capillaries and a few larger vessels. Given the age of the patient and location of the lesion combined with the histopathologic findings, the diagnosis was adjusted into angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma. Additional molecular research, performed in support of this diagnosis, showed a gene fusion mutation of EWSR1-CREB1 t(2;22)(q33;q12), while mutations in BRAF and NRAS genes could not be detected.

She had been working as a koji brewer in a factory of her family's koji-brewing business for 30 years. Results of pulmonary function tests were within normal range, and blood gas analysis showed values within normal limits. Laboratory tests showed normal range of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, Na, Cl, and K. Chest X-ray showed no abnormal shadows, but computed tomography showed ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules in both upper lobes. Bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial lung biopsy were performed, and A. oryzae was cultured from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, with a serum precipitating antibody against A. oryzae being positive. A. oryzae was repeatedly isolated from her factory. The patient's symptoms improved after admission, and the ground-glass opacities and centrilobular nodules on computed tomography improved. She was diagnosed with HP due to A. oryzae during the course of her hospital stay.\n",

      "The patient, a 42-year-old woman with bilateral gonarthrosis, presented for a left-sided total knee arthroplasty. Spinal anesthesia and preoperative insertion of femoral and sciatic nerve catheters for postoperative analgesia were planned. The femoral nerve was located using a nerve stimulator, and a catheter was inserted. During the catheter insertion, the catheter was inadvertently inserted to a depth of 25 cm and encountered significant resistance, leading to surgical intervention to remove the catheter. Insertion of the sciatic nerve catheter and performance of spinal anesthesia were later performed without any issues. The catheter was found to have passed through the ileopectineal arch and formed a knot dorsal to it. The knot was removed, and the total knee arthroplasty, as well as the postoperative course of the patient, were uncomplicated.\n",

The X-ray showed dilated bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels. Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) abdomen revealed stricture in proximal jejunum with dilated edematous proximal jejunal loops and thrombosis of portomesenteric confluence with extension into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and that was replaced by multiple collaterals. The diagnosis of critical stricture with proximal bowel dilatation was made.

      "The patient presented to our facility with an acute onset of retrosternal chest pain. She had a history of similar episodes on and off for a year, but did not seek medical attention before. The initial investigation reports, including complete blood count, renal function tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), and chest X-ray were unremarkable. Cardiac enzymes excluded an acute coronary syndrome. However, computed tomography (CT) of the chest with contrast showed a linear hypodensity within the main pulmonary artery (MPA) suggestive of an intimal dissection flap of the trunk of the MPA without dilation. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, with normal flow through the right heart and pulmonary valve. A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed an intimal dissection flap of the MPA with no evidence of congenital heart disease. The patient received treatment with oxygen and diltiazem and was referred to the cardiothoracic surgeons, who offered her a surgical repair. However, the patient declined the surgical option due to its high risk nature. She was kept on diltiazem with a close follow-up and was stable almost a year since her initial presentation.\n",

      "The patient presented to the emergency department with direct left elbow trauma sustained in a fall while playing with friends. On examination, the limb's neurovascular status was intact, range of motion was restricted by pain, and the fingers were mobile and sensitive. X-rays revealed anterior and lateral transolecranon dislocation. Closed reduction was attempted twice under general anesthesia in the operating room using an X-ray image intensifier but was unsuccessful due to buttonholing through the torn anterior capsule. A lateral approach was taken, and the joint was reduced under direct vision, with the radial head released and found to be stable following reduction. Internal fixation of the olecranon was not performed as the joint was stable. The reduced joint was immobilized externally using a splint for four weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recovery was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged after wound inspection on the third postoperative day. After removal of the splint a month later, the patient was referred for rehabilitation and assisted active range of motion exercises due to incomplete extension. After three months, the patient recovered good range of motion and showed only 10° of sequellar extension lag, complete range of pronation and supination movements, and was able to perform all daily activities.

      "The patient, a 26-year-old woman with a history of blurred vision and ocular pain, presented to the hospital with significant vision loss in both eyes. The patient was initially treated with various eye drops but her vision continued to decline. Further testing revealed bilateral angle closure glaucoma and extensive peripheral anterior synechiae. The patient underwent clear lens extraction with intraocular lens implantation and goniosynechialysis in the left eye, which was followed by Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy and diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. Following TCP treatment, the patient's vision improved and IOP decreased, leading to phacoemulsification, intraocular lens implantation, and goniosynechialysis in the right eye. \n",
      "\n",
      "The patient's exam showed deep anterior chamber centrally but shallow peripherally without inflammation or posterior synechiae. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed angle closure in the setting of iris thickening and plateau iris-like configuration with an anteriorly rotated ciliary body and iris root. Fundus examination was notable for bilateral cup-to-disc ratio of 0.95, horizontal macular pucker with mild vascular tortuosity, and discrete, round, yellow-white deposits of variable sizes scattered throughout the macula and posterior pole. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) revealed cystoid macular edema associated with retinoschisis as well as increased reflectivity of the vitreoretinal interface in both eyes with pre-retinal tractional membranes. Additionally, fundus fluorescein angiography and fundus autofluorescence showed scattered early hyperfluorescence and perifoveal hypo-autofluorescence in the right eye worse than left eyes and hyper-autofluorescence in the posterior pole corresponding to the areas of hyperfluorescence seen on fundus fluorescein angiography. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the fundus findings and results of ancillary testing, a diagnosis of ARB was made. Whole-exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous missense mutation, c.1 A > G, p.M1V in BEST1. Bidirectional Sanger sequencing of parents further confirmed that both were heterozygous for the same variant. Upon further inquiry, it was revealed that there was a history of consanguinity. \n",
      "\n",
      "At six months following TCP treatment, the patient's vision improved and IOP decreased to a normal range without anti-glaucoma medications. There was no change in fundus examination with no recurrence of retinoschisis on OCT. \n",

Diagnostic workup showed disseminated malignancy with metastatic lesions to anterior chest wall, liver, lungs, and a necrotic 3.5 cm nodal mass in the left gastric region. A repeat MRI spine with contrast showed a 20*10*19 mm enhancing soft tissue metastatic mass lesion seen within conus. An endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed a deep, malignant-looking gastric ulcer on the high anterior greater curve of the stomach. Biopsy from the stomach lesion surprisingly showed a metastatic malignant melanoma with a mutation within codon 600. The patient was managed with palliative treatment.\n",

      "The patient was admitted to undergo an emergency cadaveric donor liver transplantation due to his medical history. Prior to the surgery, various diagnostic tests including ECG, echocardiography, and blood tests were conducted. During the surgery, the patient encountered a sudden-onset large QRS tachycardia, which triggered a cardiac arrest. The patient was subjected to CPR, and various medication including epinephrine, amiodarone, and lidocaine were administered. After a prolonged resuscitation attempt, spontaneous circulation was resumed. However, the patient continued to be unstable, and required medication support with milrinone, epinephrine, vasopressin, and fluids. On the second day of ICU admission, the patient encountered pulseless large QRS tachycardia twice, which were resolved with defibrillation and cardiac compression. However, following these episodes, the patient's medical condition worsened, including metabolic acidosis, intravascular volume loss, and pulmonary edema. Despite aggressive interventions, the patient expired on the fourth day of admission.\n",

The cubitus valgus was corrected by a supracondylar medial closing wedge osteotomy. A plaster slab was applied for four weeks, and the implants were removed after bone healing at three months. The recovery of ulna sensation was noted six weeks after surgery. The clawing of the ring and little fingers resolved one year after surgery.\n",

      "The patient, a 56-year-old female from Afghanistan, presented to the surgical outpatient department with epigastric pain and fluid draining from the left side of her abdomen after drinking liquids. She had undergone laprotomy and necrosectomy for necrotizing pancreatitis in Afghanistan 10 days ago. Blood tests revealed abnormal white blood cell levels, and a gastrograffin study showed external drainage of contrast from the stomach. A CT scan revealed abdominal collections in the lesser sac and peri pancreatic region. The patient underwent a re-exploratory surgery where the abdominal drain from the stomach was removed, and primary repair of the gastric perforation with omentopexy was performed. The patient had an uneventful post-operative recovery and was discharged home on the 6th post-operative day.\n",

The follow-up pulmonary function test showed significant improvement to FVC of 129% and FEV1 110%. The HFMSE, which reflects motor function and muscle strength, improved from 29 to 32. Upper motor function, as assessed by item 13 of HFMSE (ability to prop on extended arms), improved from score 1 to 2. The item 15, which assessed whether the patient could complete a four-point kneeling, also improved from score 1 to 2.\n",

The pathologic findings showed noncaseating granulomas without malignant cells, consistent with sarcoidosis. After 5 months, the patient presented again with aggravating right hilar lymphadenopathy. 30 mg per day oral prednisone for 3 months was prescribed, which had waxing and waning effect. At 2 months follow-up, the chest CT scan showed a newly developed right lower paratracheal lymphadenopathy and worsening right hilar lymphadenopathy despite improving the subcarinal and both interlobar lymphadenopathies.

      "The patient is a 26-year-old pregnant woman diagnosed with HIV-1 infection in August 2016. At diagnosis, her CD4 count was 60 cells/mm3 and plasmatic viral load was 7,060,000 copies/mL. She was immediately started on antiretroviral (ARV) therapy with abacavir/lamivudine/dolutegravir (DTG) once daily. Despite a significant reduction in the viral load, she never achieved plasmatic undetectability at follow-up. Her therapeutic regimen was intensified with darunavir (DRV)-ritonavir (800/100 mg) once daily. However, the plasmatic HIV-RNA remained detectable. An additional dose of DTG (50 mg) was included in the regimen anticipating bioavailability reduction. The patient's regimen was modified back to abacavir/lamivudine/DTG (600/300/50 mg) once daily with positive results. She delivered a healthy baby, and both mother and baby are doing well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hospital Course Summary:\n",
      "The patient was hospitalized due to pregnancy-related complications related to HIV-1 infection. During her hospital stay, she underwent regular gynecologic follow-up and HIV clinic controls. An electronic monitoring system of withdrawn drug boxes was used to ensure good adherence to her therapeutic regimen. A blood sample was collected at 23 weeks of gestation to determine the effective plasmatic concentration of DTG and DRV and to document plasmatic levels of ARV drugs. Trough plasma concentration (Ctrough) was measured by validated liquid chromatography? mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). For both drugs, analysis revealed a Ctrough lower than expected in non-pregnant adults. However, the patient's fetus had normal growth and no major abnormalities were detected at ultrasound examinations. In accordance with the Italian guidelines, a cesarean section was recommended at 34 weeks of gestation. The patient delivered a healthy baby, and there were no subsequent obstetric complications. Ten weeks after delivery, DTG and DRV concentrations in maternal blood were again examined, and the Ctroughs showed normal levels of bioavailability for a non-pregnant adult.\n",

Following an endoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with a polypoid mass in the right nasal cavity, which was causing lateral nasal wall deviation. CT and MRI scans revealed a well-defined, heterogeneously enhancing ovoid mass lesion extending from the right nasal cavity into the posterior ethmoid air cells and nasopharynx. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a glomangiopericytoma, which showed positivity to vimentin and SMA, and negative reactions with S-100 protein, desmin, and myogenin.\n",

      "Due to the bleeding propensity of the tumour, preoperative embolisation was performed to reduce perioperative blood loss and facilitate complete removal. Under general anaesthesia and systemic heparinization, both internal maxillary arteries were sequentially catheterised and embolised with microparticles, leading to complete devascularisation of the tumour. The surgery involved an endoscopic right middle meatal antrostomy followed by a ? powered??reduction of middle turbinate using microdebrider, anterior, and posterior ethmoidectomy, and a sphenoidotomy. The axilla of middle turbinate remained intact to guide as a landmark for future surgery. The lesion was successfully removed with no complications.\n",

On examination, a small opening was found on the ventral side of the penis slightly proximal to corona, along with a deep pit at the external urethral meatus. The glans and prepuce were normal with a good quality Skin Bridge between the fistula and frenulum. The length of the penis was normal for age with absence of chordee. Calibrating the pit at the site of a normal meatus under sedation detected that the urethra distal to the fistulous opening was patent, and hence the diagnosis of congenital urethrocutaneous fistula was made. The child was able to pass urine with a thin stream from the external meatus following calibration. However, two weeks post-cannulation, there was complete re-obliteration of the distal urethra. \n",

      "The patient was admitted to the hospital with severe epigastric pain that spontaneously disappeared after 3 months. During that time, abdominal ultrasonography was periodically performed and revealed a pancreatic cystic lesion at the tail of the pancreas. The cyst was initially 3.1? cm in diameter, and the MPD was dilated 10? mm in diameter. Subsequent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) did not show any ascites, evidence of cystic disruption, mural nodule nor enhanced lesion. However, six months later, the pancreatic cyst had increased in size to 6? cm with disruption of the cyst and spreading of mucinous content in the abdomen. This caused scallop edge on the liver and spleen. The patient was diagnosed with IPMN with rupture pancreatic cyst and PMP. In the operating room, a gelatinous content containing mild atypical cells was removed, followed by distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy, right hemicolectomy, total gastrectomy, and peritonectomy. The patient had a CCR 0 achieved. The procedure caused intraoperative bleeding of 4100? ml, and HIPEC was omitted. The pathological study revealed malignant IPMN with rupture pancreatic cyst with high-grade PMP, no lymphatic involvement, and free margin. \n",

      "The patient was admitted to the surgical out-patient department with severe and intermittent perianal pain. She had no history of perianal disease and other localized organic disorders. Extensive investigations, including rectoscopy, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging, were conducted, with no other pathologic conditions identified. The patient was diagnosed with proctalgia fugax, according to Rome III criteria for functional anorectal pain.\n",

      "Various conservative measures were used initially to manage the patient's symptoms, including warm baths, analgesics, spasmolytics, relaxation techniques, inhaled salbutamol, biofeedback and psychiatric interventions. However, none of these measures led to any improvement, necessitating the consideration of other treatment options.\n",
      "\n",
      "After counseling and informed consent, injection of botulinum A toxin was suggested, as an option for proctalgia treatment. Eighty units of botulinum A toxin were administered locally, in 8 sites within the internal anal sphincter to reduce pressure. The intervention was realized as a 1-day treatment, with complete relief of symptoms observed 2 days later.\n",
      "\n",
      "A follow-up control, conducted 3 months later, revealed mild pain recurrence, which was treated with a second local administration of 100 U botulinum toxin, using the same technique. Eight months after the second intervention, the patient reported no recurrence of symptoms and remained completely symptom-free.\n",
